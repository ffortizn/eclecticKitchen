Project Description

The eclecticKitchen app will be for the aspiring cook that needs some help combining ingredients. The app will allow the user to make the most of the ingredients they already have at home. After they input the items they have, the app will suggest dishes they can make using the ingredients at home and show any ingrediens they may still be missing. 

User Story

As a novice culinary enthusiasts, I want to have a recipe generator that creats recipes based on the items I have so that I can make quality meals at home on a budget.  

User Flow

1. Input the ingredients you have available to use

2. As you input items a list of ingredients to search will generate.

3. Click the 'submit' button, and 3 recipe cards with a title and meal photograph will generate on the right-side panel.

4. If desired, more recipes can be viewed by scrolling up the right-side panel.

5. Click on a recipe card title to expand and view information on ingredients used, ingredients needed, and cooking instructions.

6. To move on to a new recipe click on the recipe card title to close and repeat step #5 to view another recipe card.

7. TO generate a different set of recipe recommendations, remove and/or add ingredients on the left-side panel.
